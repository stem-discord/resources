### OpenStax: free Highschool+University level STEM textbooks
If you're a STEM student in need of a course textbook (and don't want to spend any money), check out https://openstax.org/subjects. 
You'll find a wide range of course content from pre-algebra to anatomy and physiology, freely available to access over the web or in PDF/EPUB form. 
The online versions of the textbooks include the ability to add annotations and explore additional study links/further detail. 

Each textbook also includes a range of student resources to further help you ace your course. Check it out! 


### Anki: Long term memory on easy mode

If your course requires a lot of content memorisation, try using the Anki flashcard app https://apps.ankiweb.net/  on Windows/Linux/Android/iOS. It greatly decreases time spent studying or greatly increases the amount learned in the same period.

Anki is magical because it combines two evidence-based learning techniques: The 'spacing effect' (encoding memories is more efficient when spread out over a longer period of time) and the 'testing effect' (memories become stronger when there is a challenge to remember compared to trying to 'save' content into memory repeatedly, i.e. re-reading textbooks). 
It does this using an algorithm that learns how well you know each concept, so it asks you things that are 'easy' less frequently compared to concepts that are harder/things you're about to forget. 

If you don't want to create your own flashcards, you can find shared anki decks here: https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/  . If you're studying medicine  https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/wiki/index/ is a brilliant resource.

Protips: 
- The glossaries of textbooks can help you prepare thousands of flashcards using vocabulary->definition prompts
- Anki works better if you have an understanding of the content before trying to form long-term memories. Create your flashcards after you learned the basics/read through the chapters.
- It's better to create many smaller flashcards rather than trying to remember what's on the back of fewer, but larger cards. It helps the algorithm learn which part of the concepts you might need to work on more.
- Be honest with how well you were able to remember what was on the back of a card. Clicking 'again' might feel frustrating but it's essential for the algorithm to know what you know (and what you don't)
- The spacing effect works when you have time to spread revision sessions out. Meaning Anki works best if you use it routinely throughout the term rather than cramming the night before a test
